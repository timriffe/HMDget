Package deprecated
==================

I suggest you use HMD grabber functions from the DemogBerkeley package instead. This one was an early package of mine, and was poorly coded such that it was hard to maintain. The same functionality can now be found in the DemogBerkeley package, but much more modular and robust. 

Feel free to mine this.

a function to make data extracts from the Human Mortality Database, local or online
