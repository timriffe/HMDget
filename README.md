Package deprecated
==================

I suggest you use HMD grabber functions from the HMDHFDplus package instead (now on CRAN). This one was an early package of mine, and was poorly coded such that it was hard to maintain. 

HMDget
======

a function to make data extracts from the Human Mortality Database, local or online. Almost certainly broken now, and unmaintained.
