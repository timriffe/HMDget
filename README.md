Package deprecated
==================

I suggest you use HMD grabber functions from the DemogBerkeley package instead (also on github). This one was an early package of mine, and was poorly coded such that it was hard to maintain. The same functionality can now be found in the DemogBerkeley package, but much more modular and robust. See installation instructions for that package here: https://github.com/UCBdemography/DemogBerkeley

(incidentally, that package also now has a function for reading in HFD data from the web)

Feel free to mine this.

HMDget
======

a function to make data extracts from the Human Mortality Database, local or online
